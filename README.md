# exit1.dev

**Website monitoring that doesn't get in your way.**

exit1 is an uptime monitoring platform built for developers and teams who need reliable visibility into their infrastructure. It watches your websites, APIs, SSL certificates, and TCP/UDP services around the clock — and alerts you the moment something goes wrong.

## Why exit1?

Most monitoring tools are either too bloated or too basic. exit1 sits in the sweet spot: powerful enough to cover real-world needs (multi-region checks, response validation, webhook alerts, status pages) without burying you in dashboards you'll never use.
