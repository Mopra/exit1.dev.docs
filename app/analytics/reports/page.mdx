# Reports

Reports provide aggregated analytics about your monitoring data.

## SLA Compliance

Track your service level agreement compliance:

- **Uptime percentage** over configurable time periods
- **Target comparison** - Compare actual uptime against your SLA target
- **Violation tracking** - Identify periods where SLA was breached

### Example SLA Targets

| SLA Level | Allowed Downtime/Month |
|---|---|
| 99.9% | 43.8 minutes |
| 99.95% | 21.9 minutes |
| 99.99% | 4.3 minutes |

## Response Time Distribution

Analyze response time patterns across your checks:

- **Average response time** over the selected period
- **P50, P90, P95, P99 percentiles** - Understand response time distribution
- **Min/Max response times** - Identify outliers
- **Trend analysis** - See how response times change over time

## Incident Intervals

Review downtime events and their patterns:

- **Incident count** - Total number of downtime events
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** - Average time between incidents
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** - Average incident duration
- **Longest incident** - Your worst downtime event
- **Incident timeline** - Chronological view of all incidents

## Time Ranges

Reports can be generated for:

| Range | Description |
|---|---|
| Last 24 hours | Recent performance |
| Last 7 days | Weekly overview |
| Last 30 days | Monthly summary |
| Last 90 days | Quarterly review |
| Custom range | Any date range within retention limits |

## Best Practices

- Review reports weekly to catch performance trends early
- Use SLA compliance reports in stakeholder communications
- Track MTTR over time to measure incident response improvement
- Export data via the API for custom reporting dashboards
