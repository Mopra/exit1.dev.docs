# Uptime Statistics

Detailed uptime calculation methodology and performance breakdown.

## Uptime Calculation

Uptime is calculated as:

```
Uptime % = (Total Checks - Failed Checks) / Total Checks * 100
```

### What Counts as a Failure

A check is counted as failed when:

- The HTTP status code does not match the expected status code
- The response validation fails
- The connection times out
- A network error occurs
- The TCP/UDP connection is refused

### What Doesn't Count

The following are excluded from uptime calculations:

- **Paused periods** - Time when the check is paused
- **Smart verification passes** - If the 30-second re-check succeeds, the initial failure is not counted
- **Maintenance windows** - Documented maintenance periods (if annotated)

## Performance Breakdown

Each check captures detailed timing metrics:

### DNS Lookup
Time to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Average | Typical DNS resolution time |
| P95 | 95th percentile DNS time |
| Max | Slowest DNS resolution |

### TCP Connect
Time to establish the TCP connection after DNS resolution.

### TLS Handshake
Time to complete the TLS/SSL handshake (HTTPS only). Includes certificate verification.

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)
Time from sending the request to receiving the first byte of the response. This is often the most meaningful metric for server-side performance.

### Total Response Time
The complete end-to-end time: DNS + Connect + TLS + TTFB + Content Transfer.

## Viewing Statistics

### Per-Check Stats
Navigate to a check's detail page to see its uptime statistics and performance breakdown.

### Aggregated Stats
The dashboard provides an overview of uptime across all checks.

### API Access
Access uptime statistics programmatically via the [Check Stats API endpoint](/api-reference/check-stats).

## Best Practices

- Use TTFB as the primary metric for server-side performance
- Monitor DNS resolution time for CDN and DNS provider performance
- Track TLS handshake time to identify certificate issues
- Compare performance across regions to identify geographic bottlenecks
