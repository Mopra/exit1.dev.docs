# Email Alerts

Email is the primary alert channel in exit1.dev, available on all plans.

## Configuration

### Recipients

Add email addresses that should receive alerts. You can add:

- Your account email (added by default)
- Team member email addresses
- Distribution lists or group addresses

### Per-Check Overrides

Override the default recipient list for individual checks. This is useful for:

- Routing alerts to the team responsible for a specific service
- Sending critical check alerts to on-call addresses
- Reducing noise by limiting recipients for non-critical checks

## Quotas

| Plan | Hourly Limit | Monthly Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Free | 10 emails/hour | 10 emails/month |
| Nano | — | 1,000 emails/month |

When you reach a quota limit:

- No more email alerts are sent until the limit resets
- Other alert channels (webhooks, Slack, Discord) continue to work
- A warning is displayed in the dashboard
- Hourly limits reset every hour; monthly limits reset on the 1st

## Email Content

Alert emails include:

- **Check name** and URL
- **Status change** (e.g., "DOWN" or "RECOVERED")
- **Timestamp** of the event
- **Response time** and status code (if applicable)
- **Error details** for failed checks
- **Direct link** to the check in the dashboard

## Best Practices

- Add a team distribution list rather than individual emails
- Use per-check overrides to route alerts to responsible teams
- Monitor your quota usage on the dashboard
- Combine email alerts with webhooks for critical services
