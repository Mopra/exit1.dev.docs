# Alerting

exit1.dev provides multi-channel alerting to keep you informed when your checks change status.

## Alert Channels

| Channel | Free Plan | Nano Plan |
|---|---|---|
| Email | 10/hour, 10/month | 1,000/month |
| SMS | Not available | Available (20/month) |
| Team Alerts | Not available | Available |
| Webhooks | 1 | Unlimited |
| Slack | Available | Available |
| Discord | Available | Available |

## How Alerting Works

1. A check runs and detects a status change (e.g., up to down)
2. Smart verification re-checks after 30 seconds to confirm
3. The consecutive failure threshold is evaluated
4. If the threshold is met, alerts are dispatched to all configured channels
5. When the check recovers, recovery alerts are sent

## Flap Suppression

To prevent alert fatigue from flapping services (rapidly alternating between up and down), exit1.dev uses the `minConsecutiveEvents` setting. This requires a minimum number of consecutive events before triggering an alert, reducing noise from unstable endpoints.

## Alert Configuration

Alerts can be configured at two levels:

- **Account level** - Default alert settings applied to all checks
- **Per-check level** - Override settings for individual checks
