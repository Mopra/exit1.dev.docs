# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What happens if I exceed my monitor limit?
You cannot create new monitors beyond your plan limit (50 on Free). Existing checks continue to run. Upgrade to the Nano plan for unlimited monitors.

### Can I change my plan at any time?
Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period.

### Is there a free trial of the Nano plan?
The Free plan serves as a trial. You can use it indefinitely and upgrade when you need more capacity.

## Monitoring

### How accurate are the uptime calculations?
Uptime is calculated based on every check execution. With 1-minute intervals on the Nano plan, you get 1,440 data points per day for highly accurate uptime tracking.

### What happens during a network outage at the monitoring region?
If a monitoring region experiences issues, checks may be delayed. exit1.dev runs from Google Cloud infrastructure for high availability.

### Can I monitor internal/private endpoints?
exit1.dev monitors endpoints that are publicly accessible from the internet. Internal endpoints behind firewalls are not supported.

## Alerting

### Why am I not receiving email alerts?
Check the following:
1. Verify your email address is in the alert recipients list
2. Check your spam/junk folder
3. Confirm you haven't exceeded your email alert quota
4. Ensure the check has alerting enabled

### Can I receive alerts for specific checks only?
Yes. Configure per-check alert overrides to control which checks trigger alerts and to which recipients.

### How do I avoid alert fatigue?
- Increase the consecutive failure threshold
- Use the `minConsecutiveEvents` flap suppression setting
- Route non-critical alerts to a dedicated channel

## Billing

### What payment methods are accepted?
We accept all major credit and debit cards through our payment processor.

### Can I get a refund?
Contact support within 14 days of a charge for a refund evaluation.

### Is there annual billing?
Yes. exit1.dev offers both monthly and annual billing. Save 25% with annual billing.

### What happens if my payment fails?
Your account continues on the Nano plan for a grace period. If payment is not resolved, your account is downgraded to the Free plan.

## API

### How do I get an API key?
Navigate to **Settings** > **API** and click **Create API Key**. API access is available on all plans.

### Can I create or modify checks via the API?
The current API is read-only. You can retrieve check data, history, and statistics. Check management via API is planned for a future release.

### What are the API rate limits?
See the [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) documentation for detailed rate limit information.
