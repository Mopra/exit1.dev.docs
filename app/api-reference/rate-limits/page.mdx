# Rate Limits

The exit1.dev API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability.

## Limits

| Scope | Limit |
|---|---|
| Pre-authentication | 20 requests/minute per IP |
| Per API key | 5 requests/minute |
| Per endpoint (per key) | 1 request/minute |
| Daily per key | 500 requests |
| Daily per user | 2,000 requests |

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit headers:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the rate limit window resets |

## Exceeding Limits

When you exceed a rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after the reset time.",
    "retryAfter": 60
  }
}
```

The `retryAfter` field indicates how many seconds to wait before making another request.

## Best Practices

- Cache API responses locally when possible
- Implement exponential backoff when receiving 429 responses
- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to stay within limits
- Spread requests evenly over time rather than bursting
- Use cursor-based pagination to reduce the number of requests needed
