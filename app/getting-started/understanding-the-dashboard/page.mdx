# Understanding the Dashboard

The exit1.dev dashboard provides multiple views to help you monitor and manage your checks.

## Dashboard Views

### Table View

The default view displays all your checks in a sortable table with columns for:

- **Name** - The check name with status indicator
- **URL/Host** - The monitored endpoint
- **Status** - Current status (up, down, error)
- **Response Time** - Latest response time in milliseconds
- **Uptime** - Percentage uptime over the selected period
- **Last Checked** - Timestamp of the most recent check

### Folder View

Organize your checks into folders for logical grouping. Folders help you:

- Group checks by project, environment, or team
- Apply bulk operations to all checks in a folder
- Include entire folders in status pages

### Map View

The map view shows the geographic distribution of your check regions, giving you a visual overview of where your monitoring is running from.

### Timeline View

The timeline view displays check events chronologically, showing:

- Status changes (up/down transitions)
- Response time trends
- Alert events

## Status Indicators

| Color | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Green | Up | Check is passing successfully |
| Red | Down | Check is failing |
| Yellow | Degraded | Check is experiencing issues but not fully down |
| Gray | Paused | Check is not currently running |

## Response Time Charts

Each check includes a response time chart that shows performance over time. The chart displays:

- **Response time trend line**
- **Performance breakdown** (DNS lookup, TCP connect, TLS handshake, Time to First Byte)
- **Configurable time range** (1 hour to 30 days)

## Filtering and Search

Use the dashboard filters to narrow down your checks:

- **Status filter** - Show only up, down, or paused checks
- **Search** - Find checks by name or URL
- **Folder filter** - Show checks in a specific folder

## Quick Actions

From the dashboard, you can quickly:

- **Pause/Resume** a check
- **Edit** check settings
- **Delete** a check
- **View history** and detailed logs
- **Trigger** an immediate check run
