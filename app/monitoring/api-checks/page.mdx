# API Checks

API checks extend website checks with full support for REST endpoint monitoring, including custom HTTP methods, headers, and request bodies.

## HTTP Methods

API checks support all standard HTTP methods:

| Method | Use Case |
|---|---|
| GET | Retrieve data, health endpoints |
| POST | Test endpoint availability with payload |
| PUT | Verify update endpoints |
| PATCH | Verify partial update endpoints |
| DELETE | Test deletion endpoints (use with caution) |
| HEAD | Check endpoint availability without body |
| OPTIONS | Verify CORS configuration |

## Custom Headers

Add custom headers to your API check requests. Common use cases:

- **Authorization** - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for authenticated endpoints
- **Content-Type** - `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON payloads
- **Accept** - `Accept: application/json` to request specific response formats
- **Custom headers** - Any application-specific headers your API requires

> **Note:** Avoid including sensitive credentials in check headers. Consider using a dedicated monitoring API key with read-only access.

## Request Body

For POST, PUT, and PATCH methods, you can specify a request body. The body is sent as-is, so ensure your `Content-Type` header matches the body format.

### JSON Example

Set `Content-Type: application/json` and provide a JSON body:

```json
{
  "ping": true
}
```

## Response Validation

Combine API checks with [response validation](/monitoring/response-validation) to verify that your API returns the expected data:

- **JSONPath expressions** - Extract specific values from JSON responses
- **Expected values** - Compare extracted values against expected results
- **Text containment** - Verify that the response contains specific text

## Best Practices

- Use dedicated health check endpoints (e.g., `/health` or `/api/status`)
- Set up a monitoring-specific API key with minimal permissions
- Use response validation to verify response content, not just status codes
- Monitor both the API itself and downstream dependencies
