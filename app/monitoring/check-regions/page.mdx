# Check Regions

exit1.dev runs monitoring checks from multiple geographic regions to provide global coverage.

## Available Regions

| Region | Location | Identifier |
|---|---|---|
| US Central | United States (Central) | `us-central` |
| Europe West | Western Europe | `eu-west` |
| Asia Southeast | Southeast Asia | `asia-southeast` |

## Region Selection

### Auto Assignment
When set to **Auto**, exit1.dev selects the region automatically. This is the default setting and is recommended for most use cases.

### Manual Override
You can manually select a specific region for each check. This is useful when:

- You want to monitor from a region close to your users
- You're testing region-specific content delivery
- You need consistent results from a single location

## Multi-Region Monitoring

Each check runs from one region at a time. The region determines:

- **Network path** - The route between the monitoring server and your endpoint
- **Latency baseline** - Expected response times vary by geographic distance
- **DNS resolution** - DNS may return different results based on region (GeoDNS)

## Best Practices

- Use **Auto** for general monitoring
- Select a specific region when testing regional performance
- Consider creating separate checks for different regions if global coverage is critical
- Account for geographic distance when setting response time expectations
