# Check Intervals

Check intervals determine how frequently exit1.dev monitors your endpoints.

## Available Intervals

| Plan | Interval | Checks per Hour |
|---|---|---|
| Free | 5 minutes | 12 |
| Nano | 1 minute | 60 |

## Smart Verification

When a check fails for the first time, exit1.dev performs a **smart verification** re-check after **30 seconds**. This helps eliminate false positives caused by:

- Temporary network glitches
- Brief server restarts
- DNS propagation delays
- CDN cache refreshes

Only if the verification check also fails will the check be marked as down.

## Consecutive Failure Thresholds

You can configure a **consecutive failure threshold** (1-99) for each check. The check is only marked as down after the specified number of consecutive failures.

| Threshold | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 1 (default) | Alert after the first failure (after smart verification) |
| 2 | Alert after 2 consecutive failures |
| 3 | Alert after 3 consecutive failures |
| ... | ... |
| 99 | Alert after 99 consecutive failures |

### When to Increase the Threshold

- **Flaky endpoints** - Services that occasionally return errors but recover quickly
- **Maintenance windows** - Reduce noise during planned maintenance
- **Non-critical checks** - When you only want to be alerted for persistent outages

## Timing Behavior

- Checks run at fixed intervals starting from the creation time
- The interval timer starts after the previous check completes
- Timeout is separate from the interval (a slow response doesn't delay the next check)
- Pausing a check stops the interval; resuming starts a new cycle immediately
