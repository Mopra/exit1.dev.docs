# Monitoring

exit1.dev supports three types of monitoring checks to cover your infrastructure needs: website checks, API checks, and TCP/UDP checks.

## Check Types

### Website Checks
HTTP/HTTPS monitoring for websites and web applications. Configure expected status codes, handle redirects, and validate responses.

### API Checks
REST endpoint monitoring with support for all HTTP methods, custom headers, request bodies, and response validation.

### TCP/UDP Checks
Socket-level monitoring for non-HTTP services like databases, mail servers, and custom protocols.

- **Consecutive failure thresholds** - Require multiple failures before alerting
- **Smart verification** - Automatic 30-second re-check on first failure
- **SSL monitoring** - Automatic certificate validation for HTTPS endpoints
- **Alerting** - Email, SMS, webhook, Slack, and Discord notifications
- **History and analytics** - Detailed logs, uptime statistics, and reports
