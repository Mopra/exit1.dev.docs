# Monitoring

exit1.dev supports three types of monitoring checks to cover your infrastructure needs: website checks, API checks, and TCP/UDP checks.

## Check Types

### Website Checks
HTTP/HTTPS monitoring for websites and web applications. Configure expected status codes, handle redirects, and validate responses.

### API Checks
REST endpoint monitoring with support for all HTTP methods, custom headers, request bodies, and response validation.

### TCP/UDP Checks
Socket-level monitoring for non-HTTP services like databases, mail servers, and custom protocols.

## Maintenance Mode

Temporarily suppress alerts and freeze status during planned maintenance windows. Checks keep running and collecting data, but no alerts fire and your uptime stats stay clean. Available as immediate, scheduled, or recurring windows.

## Common Features

All check types share these capabilities:

- **Smart verification** - Automatic 30-second re-check on first failure
- **SSL monitoring** - Automatic certificate validation for HTTPS endpoints
- **Alerting** - Email, SMS, webhook, Slack, and Discord notifications
- **History and analytics** - Detailed logs, uptime statistics, and reports
