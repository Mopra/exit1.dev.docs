# Bulk Operations

exit1.dev provides tools for managing multiple checks at once.

## Import

### CSV Import
Import checks from a CSV file with the following columns:

- **name** (required) - Check name
- **url** (required) - URL or host to monitor
- **type** - Check type (website, api, tcp, udp)
- **method** - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- **interval** - Check interval in minutes
- **expected_status** - Expected HTTP status code
- **region** - Check region

### JSON Import
Import checks from a JSON file with an array of check objects:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Production Website",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "type": "website",
    "method": "GET",
    "expectedStatus": 200
  }
]
```

## Multi-Select

Select multiple checks in the dashboard table view to perform bulk actions:

- **Pause** - Pause all selected checks
- **Resume** - Resume all selected checks
- **Delete** - Delete all selected checks
- **Move to folder** - Move selected checks to a folder
- **Edit** - Open the bulk edit modal

## Bulk Edit Modal

The bulk edit modal lets you update settings across multiple checks at once:

- **Check interval** - Change the interval for all selected checks
- **Region** - Change the region for all selected checks
- **Consecutive failures** - Update the failure threshold
- **Alert settings** - Modify alert recipients

Only the fields you change will be updated; other settings remain unchanged.

## Folder Management

Folders help organize your checks:

- **Create folders** from the sidebar or checks page
- **Drag and drop** checks into folders
- **Nest folders** for hierarchical organization
- **Bulk actions** apply to all checks in a folder

## Best Practices

- Use CSV/JSON import when setting up monitoring for many endpoints
- Organize checks into folders by project, environment, or team
- Use multi-select for quick bulk operations
- Review changes before confirming bulk edits
