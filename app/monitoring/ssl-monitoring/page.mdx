# SSL Monitoring

exit1.dev automatically monitors SSL/TLS certificates for all HTTPS checks.

## Automatic Monitoring

SSL monitoring is enabled by default for any check using an `https://` URL. No additional configuration is required.

## What's Monitored

### Certificate Details

exit1.dev tracks the following certificate information:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Issuer** | The Certificate Authority that issued the certificate |
| **Subject** | The domain the certificate is issued for |
| **Valid From** | Certificate start date |
| **Valid To** | Certificate expiration date |
| **Serial Number** | Unique certificate identifier |
| **Fingerprint** | Certificate fingerprint for verification |

### Validation Checks

Each SSL check verifies:

- **Certificate validity** - Is the certificate currently valid?
- **Certificate chain** - Is the full chain of trust intact?
- **Expiration** - Is the certificate approaching expiration?
- **Domain match** - Does the certificate match the monitored domain?

## Refresh Cycle

SSL certificate information is refreshed every **6 hours**. This means:

- Certificate changes are detected within 6 hours
- Expiration warnings update every 6 hours
- New certificates are recognized after the next refresh cycle

## SSL Alerts

SSL-related alerts include:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `ssl_error` | Certificate is invalid, expired, or has chain issues |
| `ssl_warning` | Certificate is approaching expiration |

These alerts are sent through your configured alert channels (email, SMS, webhooks, Slack, Discord).

## Best Practices

- Monitor all production HTTPS endpoints
- Set up alert channels to receive SSL warnings before certificates expire
- Use [Domain Intelligence](/domain-intelligence) for additional domain expiration tracking
- Review certificate details periodically in the dashboard
