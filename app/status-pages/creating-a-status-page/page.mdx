Select which monitoring checks to display on your status page:

### Individual Checks
Select specific checks from your check list. Each check will appear as a line item on the status page.

### Folder-Based Inclusion
Select an entire folder to include all checks within it. When you add new checks to the folder, they automatically appear on the status page.

## Step 3: Configure Display

### Ordering
Drag and drop checks to arrange them in the order you want them displayed.
