## How Status Pages Work

A status page displays the real-time status of your selected monitoring checks. When a check goes down, the status page automatically updates to reflect the outage.

### Public vs Private

- **Public** - Accessible to anyone with the URL. Ideal for customer-facing status pages.
- **Private** - Requires authentication to view. Useful for internal team dashboards.

## Components

Status pages are built from:

- **Checks** - Individual checks or entire folders to display
- **Widgets** - Visual components that present data in different formats
- **Branding** - Logo, favicon, and brand colors
