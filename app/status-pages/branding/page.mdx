# Branding

Customize the appearance of your status page to match your brand.

## Branding Options

### Logo
Upload your company logo to display at the top of your status page. Supported formats:

- PNG (recommended)
- SVG
- JPG/JPEG

For best results, use a logo with a transparent background and a minimum width of 200px.

### Favicon
Upload a custom favicon for your status page. The favicon appears in the browser tab when viewing your status page.

Supported formats:
- ICO (recommended)
- PNG
- SVG

### Brand Color
Set a primary brand color that's used for accents and highlights throughout the status page. Enter a hex color code (e.g., `#0066FF`).

The brand color is applied to:

- Status page header background
- Active/healthy status indicators
- Links and interactive elements
- Widget accents
