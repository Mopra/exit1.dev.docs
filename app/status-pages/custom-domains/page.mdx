# Custom Domains

Host your status page on your own domain (e.g., `status.example.com`).

> **Note:** Custom domains are available on the **Nano plan** only.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Domain

Decide on the subdomain you want to use for your status page. Common choices:

- `status.example.com`
- `uptime.example.com`
- `health.example.com`

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Add a **CNAME record** in your DNS provider pointing to the exit1.dev status page host:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| CNAME | status | `status.exit1.dev` |

DNS propagation may take up to 48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes to a few hours.

### Step 3: Add Domain in exit1.dev

1. Open your status page settings
2. Navigate to the **Custom Domain** section
3. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `status.example.com`)
4. Click **Verify**

### Step 4: SSL Certificate

Once the domain is verified, exit1.dev automatically provisions an SSL certificate for your custom domain. This process is automatic and typically completes within a few minutes.

## Verification

exit1.dev verifies your custom domain by:

1. Checking the DNS CNAME record points to `status.exit1.dev`
2. Provisioning an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt
3. Confirming HTTPS access works on the custom domain

## Troubleshooting

### Domain verification fails
- Ensure the CNAME record is correctly configured
- Wait for DNS propagation to complete
- Check for conflicting DNS records (e.g., an A record on the same subdomain)

### SSL certificate not provisioning
- Verify the DNS record is active and resolving
- Ensure there are no CAA records blocking Let's Encrypt
- Wait a few minutes and try again

### Custom domain not loading
- Clear your browser cache
- Verify the DNS record with `dig status.example.com CNAME`
- Ensure the domain is verified in exit1.dev settings
