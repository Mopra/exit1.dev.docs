# Discord Integration

Receive exit1.dev monitoring alerts in your Discord server.

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Webhook in Discord

1. Open your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Webhooks**
3. Click **New Webhook**
4. Name the webhook (e.g., "exit1.dev Alerts")
5. Select the channel for notifications
6. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

### Step 2: Connect in exit1.dev

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Discord**
2. Paste the Discord webhook URL
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test

Click **Send Test Notification** to verify the connection. A test message will appear in your Discord channel.

## Notification Format

Discord notifications are sent as rich embeds:

- **Color-coded** - Red for down, green for recovery, yellow for warnings
- **Check name** as the embed title
- **Status details** in embed fields
- **Timestamp** in the embed footer

### Down Notification

A red-colored embed with:
- Title: "Production Website is DOWN"
- Fields: URL, Status Code, Error, Region
- Timestamp

### Recovery Notification

A green-colored embed with:
- Title: "Production Website is UP"
- Fields: URL, Response Time, Status Code, Region
- Timestamp

## Managing the Integration

### Updating Webhook URL
Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Discord**, update the webhook URL, and save.

### Disconnecting
Remove the webhook URL from exit1.dev settings and optionally delete the webhook from your Discord server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Notifications not appearing** - Verify the webhook URL is correct and the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord
- **Rate limiting** - Discord has rate limits on webhooks; exit1.dev handles this automatically with retries
- **Permission errors** - Ensure the webhook has permission to post in the target channel
