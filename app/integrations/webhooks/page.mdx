# Webhooks

Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications about check events at any HTTP endpoint.

## Setup

### Adding a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook**
3. Enter the webhook URL (must be HTTPS)
4. Optionally add custom headers for authentication
5. Save the webhook

You can configure up to **5 webhooks** per account.

### Custom Headers

Add custom headers to authenticate incoming webhook requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-webhook-secret
X-Webhook-Source: exit1-dev
```

## Event Payload

All webhook events are sent as `POST` requests with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "event": "website_down",
  "check": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "name": "Production API",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "type": "api",
    "method": "GET"
  },
  "status": {
    "current": "down",
    "previous": "up",
    "statusCode": 503,
    "responseTime": null,
    "error": "Service Unavailable"
  },
  "region": "us-central",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Event Types

See the full [Alert Events](/alerting/alert-events) reference for all event types.

## Retry Behavior

Failed webhook deliveries are retried with exponential backoff:

| Attempt | Delay After Failure |
|---|---|
| 1 | Immediate |
| 2 | 1 minute |
| 3 | 2 minutes |
| 4 | 4 minutes |
| 5 | 8 minutes |
| 6 | 16 minutes |
| 7 | 32 minutes |
| 8 | 64 minutes |

A delivery is considered failed if:
- The endpoint returns a non-2xx status code
- The connection times out (10 second timeout)
- The endpoint is unreachable

## Testing

Test your webhook configuration:

1. Set up your webhook endpoint
2. Click **Send Test** in the webhook settings
3. Verify your endpoint receives the test payload
4. Check the response in the webhook delivery log

## Health Monitoring

exit1.dev tracks the health of your webhook endpoints:

- **Healthy** - Recent deliveries are succeeding
- **Degraded** - Some deliveries are failing
- **Unhealthy** - Consecutive deliveries have failed

Unhealthy webhooks are flagged in the dashboard. Fix the underlying issue and the webhook will automatically recover.

## Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS endpoints
- Implement webhook signature verification using custom headers
- Return a 200 response within 10 seconds
- Process webhook payloads asynchronously
- Implement idempotency (the same event may be delivered more than once due to retries)
- Monitor webhook health in the dashboard
