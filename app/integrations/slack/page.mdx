# Slack Integration

Receive exit1.dev monitoring alerts directly in your Slack workspace.

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Slack Incoming Webhook

1. Go to [Slack API: Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
2. Create a new Slack app (or select an existing one)
3. Enable **Incoming Webhooks** for the app
4. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
5. Select the channel you want alerts posted to
6. Copy the generated webhook URL

### Step 2: Add the Webhook to exit1.dev

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack**
2. Paste your Slack webhook URL
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test

Click **Send Test Notification** to verify the connection is working. A test message will appear in your configured Slack channel.

## Notification Format

Slack notifications include:

- **Check name** and status (with color-coded indicator)
- **URL** of the monitored endpoint
- **Status details** - Response code, response time, or error message
- **Timestamp** of the event
- **Region** where the check ran
- **Direct link** to the check in exit1.dev

### Down Notification Example

> **Production Website** is **DOWN**
> URL: https://example.com
> Status: 503 Service Unavailable
> Region: US Central
> Time: Jan 15, 2025 2:30 PM UTC

### Recovery Notification Example

> **Production Website** is **UP**
> URL: https://example.com
> Response: 200 OK (245ms)
> Region: US Central
> Time: Jan 15, 2025 2:35 PM UTC

## Managing the Integration

### Changing Channel
Create a new incoming webhook in Slack for the desired channel, then update the webhook URL in **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack**.

### Removing
Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack** and click **Remove** to delete the webhook and stop Slack notifications.

## Troubleshooting

- **Notifications not appearing** - Verify the webhook URL is correct and the Slack app still has access to the channel
- **Invalid webhook URL** - Ensure the URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/`
- **Delayed notifications** - Check the exit1.dev status page for any service issues
