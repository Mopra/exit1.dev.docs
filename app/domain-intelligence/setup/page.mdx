# Domain Intelligence Setup

Learn how to enable and configure Domain Intelligence for your monitoring checks.

## Prerequisites

- An active **Nano plan** subscription
- At least one monitoring check with a domain-based URL

## Enabling Domain Intelligence

### Per-Check Setup

1. Navigate to the check you want to enable Domain Intelligence for
2. Open the check settings
3. Toggle **Domain Intelligence** to enabled
4. Save the check

The domain will be automatically extracted from the check URL and monitoring will begin.

### Automatic Domain Extraction

exit1.dev automatically extracts the base domain from your check URL:

| Check URL | Extracted Domain |
|---|---|
| `https://www.example.com/health` | `example.com` |
| `https://api.example.com/v1/status` | `example.com` |
| `https://app.example.co.uk` | `example.co.uk` |

## Domain Information

Once enabled, exit1.dev retrieves and displays:

- **Registrar** - The domain registrar
- **Registration date** - When the domain was first registered
- **Expiration date** - When the domain registration expires
- **Last updated** - When the registration was last modified
- **Status codes** - Domain status flags (e.g., clientTransferProhibited)

## RDAP Protocol

exit1.dev uses the **Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)** to query domain information. RDAP is the modern replacement for WHOIS, offering:

- Standardized JSON responses
- Better internationalization support
- Access control and authentication capabilities
- Referral support across registries

## Troubleshooting

### Domain not found
If Domain Intelligence shows "domain not found," the TLD may not support RDAP. Check the IANA RDAP Bootstrap file for supported TLDs.

### Stale data
Domain registration data is cached and refreshed periodically. If you've recently renewed a domain, it may take some time for the updated expiration date to appear.
