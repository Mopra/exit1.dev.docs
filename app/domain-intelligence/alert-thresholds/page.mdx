# Alert Thresholds

Configure when you receive alerts about upcoming domain expirations.

## Default Thresholds

By default, exit1.dev sends domain expiration alerts at the following intervals before the expiration date:

| Days Before Expiry | Alert Level |
|---|---|
| 30 days | Early warning |
| 14 days | Warning |
| 7 days | Urgent |
| 1 day | Critical |

## Customizing Thresholds

You can customize alert thresholds per domain:

1. Navigate to the check with Domain Intelligence enabled
2. Open Domain Intelligence settings
3. Modify the alert thresholds
4. Save the changes

### Custom Threshold Examples

| Use Case | Recommended Thresholds |
|---|---|
| Critical production domain | 60, 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days |
| Standard domain | 30, 14, 7, 1 days (default) |
| Low-priority domain | 14, 7, 1 days |

## Alert Events

Domain Intelligence generates the following alert events:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `domain_expiring` | Domain is approaching its expiration date (sent at each threshold) |
| `domain_expired` | Domain has passed its expiration date |
| `domain_renewed` | Domain expiration date has been extended (renewal detected) |

## Renewal Detection

When exit1.dev detects that a domain's expiration date has been extended (indicating a renewal), it:

1. Sends a `domain_renewed` alert
2. Clears any active expiration warnings
3. Resets the alert threshold cycle based on the new expiration date

## Alert Channels

Domain Intelligence alerts are sent through your configured alert channels:

- **Email** - Domain expiration warnings in your inbox
- **SMS** - Urgent expiration alerts via text (Nano plan)
- **Webhooks** - Domain events in your webhook payload
- **Slack** - Notifications in your connected Slack channel
- **Discord** - Notifications in your connected Discord channel

Configure alert channels in the [Alerting](/alerting) section.
