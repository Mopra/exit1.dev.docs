# Domain Intelligence

Domain Intelligence tracks domain registration expiration dates using the RDAP protocol, helping you avoid accidental domain lapses.

> **Note:** Domain Intelligence is available on the **Nano plan** only.

## How It Works

1. When you enable Domain Intelligence for a check, exit1.dev extracts the domain from the check URL
2. The system queries RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol) servers for domain registration data
3. Expiration dates are tracked and monitored continuously
4. Alerts are sent at configurable thresholds before the domain expires

## Key Features

- **Automatic domain extraction** - Domains are extracted from your check URLs automatically
- **RDAP protocol** - Uses the modern, standardized RDAP protocol (replacing legacy WHOIS)
- **Configurable alerts** - Set custom alert thresholds for each domain
- **Renewal detection** - Detects when a domain is renewed and clears expiration warnings
- **Per-check configuration** - Enable or disable domain tracking for individual checks

## Supported TLDs

Domain Intelligence supports any TLD that has RDAP service endpoints, which includes most major TLDs:

- `.com`, `.net`, `.org`
- `.io`, `.dev`, `.app`
- Country-code TLDs with RDAP support
- Most new gTLDs
